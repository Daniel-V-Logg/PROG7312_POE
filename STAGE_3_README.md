# Stage 3 - Search and Recommendation Logic

## What was added in this stage

### Files Modified:

1. **EventStore.cs** - Added search and recommendation methods
   - `SearchEvents(keyword, category, fromDate, toDate)` - Multi-criteria search using indexes
   - `GetRecommendations()` - Generate personalized recommendations
   - Updated `RecordSearch()` to also record in EventIndexes Stack

2. **LocalEventsForm.cs** - Wired UI to search/recommendation logic
   - `btnSearch_Click()` - Now performs actual search using indexes
   - `btnRecommend_Click()` - Shows personalized recommendations
   - Error handling for search failures

## Search Functionality

### SearchEvents Method
Implements efficient multi-criteria search using the data structures from Stage 2:

```csharp
public static List<Event> SearchEvents(
    string keyword,        // Search in title, description, location
    string category,       // Filter by category (or "All Categories")
    DateTime? fromDate,    // Start of date range
    DateTime? toDate       // End of date range
)
```

### Search Algorithm Flow:

```
1. Start with all events
   â†“
2. IF date range specified:
   â†’ Use SortedDictionary.GetEventsByDateRange() [O(log n)]
   â†“
3. IF category specified:
   â†’ Use Dictionary.GetEventsByCategory() [O(1)]
   â†’ OR filter existing results if date was used
   â†“
4. IF keyword specified:
   â†’ Filter by keyword in title/description/location
   â†’ Record search query for recommendations
   â†“
5. Return filtered results
```

### Performance Benefits:

**Traditional approach (no indexes):**
```csharp
// O(n) for every filter
results = events.Where(e => e.Date >= from && e.Date <= to);
results = results.Where(e => e.Category == category);
results = results.Where(e => e.Title.Contains(keyword));
// Total: O(n) * 3 = O(3n)
```

**Indexed approach (our implementation):**
```csharp
// Date range: O(log n + k) where k = results
results = EventIndexes.GetEventsByDateRange(from, to);

// Category: O(1) lookup
results = EventIndexes.GetEventsByCategory(category);

// Keyword: O(k) where k = results from previous filters
results = results.Where(e => e.Title.Contains(keyword));
// Total: O(log n + k) where k << n
```

**Example:** For 10,000 events with 50 results:
- Traditional: ~30,000 comparisons
- Indexed: ~60 comparisons
- **~500x faster!**

## Recommendation Engine

### GetRecommendations Method
Generates personalized event recommendations based on user's search history.

### Recommendation Algorithm:

```
1. IF no search history:
   â†’ Return top 3 most popular events (from PriorityQueue)
   â†“
2. Calculate keyword frequency from search history:
   - Split all search queries into words
   - Count how many times each word appears
   - Example: ["music", "festival", "music", "sports"]
     â†’ {"music": 2, "festival": 1, "sports": 1}
   â†“
3. Score each event:
   Base score = PopularityScore
   
   For each keyword in frequency map:
     IF keyword in event.Title:
       score += frequency Ã— 5  (title matches weighted highest)
     IF keyword in event.Description:
       score += frequency Ã— 2
     IF keyword in event.Category:
       score += frequency Ã— 3
   â†“
4. Sort events by score (descending)
   â†“
5. Return top 3 events
```

### Scoring Example:

**User Search History:**
```
["music", "festival", "community", "music"]
```

**Keyword Frequency:**
```
music: 2
festival: 1
community: 1
```

**Event Scoring:**

| Event | Base Score | Title Match | Desc Match | Category Match | **Total** |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Summer Music Festival | 15 | music(2Ã—5) + festival(1Ã—5) = 15 | festival(1Ã—2) = 2 | 0 | **32** âœ“ |
| Community Clean-Up | 0 | 0 | community(1Ã—2) = 2 | community(1Ã—3) = 3 | **5** |
| Art Gallery | 12 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **12** âœ“ |

Top 3: Music Festival (32), Art Gallery (12), Community Clean-Up (5)

### Why This Works:

1. **Frequency-based:** Keywords searched more often get higher weight
2. **Context-aware:** Title matches matter more than description
3. **Fallback:** New users get popular events instead of nothing
4. **Personalized:** Each user gets different recommendations based on their searches

## Search History Persistence

### Storage:
- **In-memory:** `EventStore.SearchHistory` (List<string>)
- **On-disk:** `Data/searchHistory.xml`
- **Also tracked in:** `EventIndexes.SearchHistory` (Stack<string>)

### Persistence Flow:
```
User searches â†’ RecordSearch(query) â†’ Add to List & Stack
                                    â†’ SaveSearchHistory()
                                    â†’ Write to XML file
```

### File Format:
```xml
<ArrayOfString>
  <string>music</string>
  <string>sports</string>
  <string>community</string>
  <string>festival</string>
</ArrayOfString>
```

## UI Integration

### Search Button:
1. Gets keyword, category, and date range from form
2. Calls `EventStore.SearchEvents()`
3. Displays results in ListView
4. Shows count in status label
5. Records search terms automatically

### Recommend Button:
1. Calls `EventStore.GetRecommendations()`
2. Shows recommendations in MessageBox dialog
3. Also displays them in ListView for easy selection
4. If no history, prompts user to search first

### Clear Filters Button:
1. Resets all input fields
2. Reloads all events
3. Updates status

3. **Verify Persistence:**
   - Do several searches
   - Close and reopen the app
   - Click "Recommend"
   - Should still have your search history!

### Verify Search History File:
```bash
# Check if search history is saved
cat bin/Debug/Data/searchHistory.xml
# Should contain your search terms
```

## Example User Flow

```
User opens app
  â†“
Clicks "Local Events"
  â†“
Searches: "community clean"
  â†’ Sees Community Clean-Up Day
  â†’ Search recorded: "community clean"
  â†“
Searches: Category="Sports"
  â†’ Sees Soccer, Marathon events
  â†’ Search recorded: "sports"
  â†“
Clicks "Recommend"
  â†’ Algorithm finds "community" and "sports" in history
  â†’ Scores all events
  â†’ Shows: Community events + Sports events ranked by relevance
  â†“
User closes app
  â†“
Later: Opens app again
Clicks "Recommend"
  â†’ Still remembers previous searches!
  â†’ Shows same personalized recommendations
```

## Performance Metrics

For a database of 10,000 events:

| Operation | Without Indexes | With Indexes | Improvement |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Date range search | O(n) ~10,000 | O(log n) ~13 | 770x faster |
| Category filter | O(n) ~10,000 | O(1) ~1 | 10,000x faster |
| Top 3 popular | O(n log n) ~133,000 | O(1) ~1 | 133,000x faster |
| Recommendations | O(n Ã— h) | O(n) | h times faster* |

*where h = search history size

## What's Next (Stage 4)

ðŸ”œ Diagnostics form to visualize data structures  
ðŸ”œ Additional UI improvements  
ðŸ”œ Advanced filtering options  
ðŸ”œ Export search results  

## Notes

- **Search is case-insensitive** - "Music" = "music" = "MUSIC"
- **Keywords are trimmed and normalized** - " festival " â†’ "festival"
- **Search history limited to 50 items** - prevents unbounded growth
- **Recommendations update in real-time** - as you search, they improve
- **Empty searches show all events** - all filters optional

The recommendation algorithm is simple but effective - it learns from what you search for and suggests similar events. The more you use it, the better it gets!
